# SAINT
**SAINTis a weakly-supervised learning method where the embedding function is learned automatically from the easily-acquired data.Compared to existing deep learning-based alignment-free method, SAINT doesnâ€™t require tedious labors to collect accurate alignment distances to train.SAINT is more computationally fast and memory efficient because
sequence data are operated in a compressed embedding space which is much faster to retrieval and succinct to store.**
